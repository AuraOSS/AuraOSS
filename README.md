# AURA OSS

Aura OSS is the Aura Open Source Software initiative. It is a place for those who wish to push their projects to eventually be featured in an community-built operating system! 

*and of course everything will be attributed to those who make each piece of software!* 

- 👀 We always accept pull requests (as long as they are original code!) ...
- 🌱 We are open to learning ... anything!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an operating system as well as any other piece of software so we can have an alternative desktop experience.
- 📫 How to reach us ...

    - Currently on Twitter as @Sprungles
